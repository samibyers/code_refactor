# code_refactor
Description: This is homework 2. I changed the semantic tags on html, I added alt tags to the navigation links and images. I fixed the navigation link for search-engine-optimization. I changed the heading attribute in the footer section to be in sequential order. I changed the title of the website to Horiseon. I consolidated some css commands that I could without changing the look or function of the website and commented on what they do. I also changed the orer of some of the css to match the flow of the html.
